                <h3>Q: Do you have a policy for screening potential adopters?<i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: Yes, we have a screening process to ensure that our animals are placed in suitable and loving
                    homes.
                    The process may involve an application, an interview, reference checks, and sometimes a home visit.
                    We
                    aim to match the needs and personalities of our animals with the lifestyle and capabilities of
                    potential
                    adopters.

                <div class="answer">
                    A: Yes, we accept owner surrenders, but we encourage you to contact us in advance to discuss your
                    situation. Surrendering a pet is a serious decision, and we want to ensure we have the necessary
                    resources to accommodate your pet's needs.

                <h3>Q: What happens if a pet is not adopted?<i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    A: If a pet is not adopted within a reasonable timeframe, we continue to provide them with care and
                    enrichment while actively seeking a suitable home. We do not have a time limit for how long an
                    animal
                    can stay with us. Our priority is finding the best match for each pet, even if it takes longer.

                    role
                    in providing care and socialization to our animals. Please contact our shelter or book an
